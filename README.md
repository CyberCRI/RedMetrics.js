# RedMetrics.js

JavaScript browser client for the open source game analytics service [RedMetrics.io](https://redmetrics.io).


## Use


## Tests

To run the tests, simply visit `tests.html` in a web browser. Certain browsers like Google Chrome require that the test page be hosted via a server rather than loaded from a file.

To use a different RedMetrics server for the tests, copy `testConfig.sample.js` to `testConfig.js`. Change the options within it as necessary.
